## My process

### Built with

- Media Queries
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- Use the properties **grid-template-areas** and **grid-area** to center a tag that contains the card.

```css
.container{
    display:grid;
    grid-template-areas:
        ". . ."
        ". card ."
        ". . .";
    }
.item {
    grid-area: card;
    }
```

- How to use **Media Queries** to make a webpage responsive for different types of devices: 

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    /** Mobile design **/
    {styles}
```
